# keysmap-tools

Tools for automatically generating PGP keys map for pgpverify-maven-plugin.

## TODO

- ☐ add optimistic canonicalization in which all signatures are accepted for (groupId,artifactId) after having been encountered once.
- ☐ grouping for entries with same groupID + version, but varying artifactID. Useful for simultaneously released modules, all with same version.
